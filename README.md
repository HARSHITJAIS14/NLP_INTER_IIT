# NLP\_INTER\_IIT

In this repo, I was getting ready for my INTER-IIT contest. I set up hands-on NLP experiments to learn more about LLMs, fine-tuning, RAG, and agentsâ€”all while diving into my ESC201 electronics material.
##  ðŸš€ Project Overview

Hereâ€™s what I played with:

* Fine-tuned Falcon (Guanaco) with LoRA & QLoRA on five ESC201 textbooks.
* Built simple and advanced RAG pipelines on the combined ESC201 text to boost answer quality.
* Created a lightweight web-search agent to experiment with tool integration.

## ðŸ”§ Fine-Tuning

* **Models:** Falcon (Guanaco) with LoRA and QLoRA.
* **Data:** Five textbooks for ESC201, cleaned and combined.
* **Goal:** Get the model to answer electronics questions well.

Check out `FIne_tuning/Finetuning_Falcon_Guanaco.ipynb` to see how I did it.

## ðŸ“š RAG Experiments

* **Basic RAG:** simple retrieval + generation (see `rag-esc_old.ipynb`).
* **Advanced RAG:** ranking and custom prompts to pick the best context (`RAG_ESC_new.ipynb`).

## ðŸ¤– Agents

I made a tiny web-search agent to chain together searches and LLM prompts.

* Notebook: `Agents/web-search-agent-tavily.ipynb`
